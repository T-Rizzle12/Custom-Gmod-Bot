# Important
This is a player bot so you will need to set the game to multiplayer and have a open player spot to create one.

This mod is also in Beta, there will be bugs, but constant updates with new features.

Although you can now clone the repository, "I will put updates into a secondary branch before releasing it," I would suggest downloading the latest release, Thank You!

# Why I made this mod
I made this because I usually have to play Gmod alone and I also wanted to see what I could do with the nextbot system.

Special thanks to [Zenlenafelex [PSF]](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198976669728) for helping me with the pathfinding code for the bot.

# Bot Cheats
I know what you are thinking, but these are needed to make the bot fun and easy to use.
- The bot will regenerate ammo for its weapons when not in combat, the regeneration of said ammo is not instant and will take some time

# Issues
- The bot doesn't know if a Nextbot is hostile or friendly, "they wont attack nextbots at all!"
- The bot doesn't know how to account for recoil on modded weapons
- The bot will lag the game if it can't find a path to its owner

# Planned Features
- [x] ~~Get the bot to detect vehicles the bot's owner is in and make the bot enter said vehicle~~
- [ ] Optimize the pathfinding code
- [ ] Get the bot to detect Nextbots
- [x] ~~Add more convars, to make the bot more customizable. :)~~
- [x] ~~Allow players to change the bot's playermodel~~
- [x] ~~Get the bot to detect if its in the dark and turn on and off its flashlight~~
- [x] ~~Get the bot to detect and jump across gaps~~
